# Telematics Integration in Auto Insurance Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive telematics-based auto insurance solution that captures real-time driving behavior data and integrates it into dynamic pricing models. The system moves beyond traditional demographic-based insurance to usage-based insurance (UBI) models like Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) and Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD).

### Key Features

- **Real-time Telematics Data Collection**: Simulated GPS, accelerometer, speed, braking, and location data
- **ML-Enhanced Risk Scoring**: Hybrid traditional + machine learning risk assessment with confidence-based switching
- **Dynamic Premium Calculation**: Usage-based pricing that adjusts based on actual driving behavior
- **Interactive Dashboard**: React-based web interface with real-time statistics and trend visualization
- **Weather Integration**: Contextual risk assessment using weather APIs
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching system for fast response times
- **6-Month Historical Data**: Realistic driving patterns across seasons and conditions


## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React.js, Chart.js, Recharts, Tailwind CSS
- **ML Models**: Python-based risk prediction with sklearn
- **APIs**: Mapbox (mapping), OpenWeatherMap (weather data)
- **Caching**: In-memory caching for performance optimization

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or MongoDB Atlas)
- Python 3.8+ (for ML service)


### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd telematics-backend

#install dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies for ML service (if not using included predictions)
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration:
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/telematics_insurance
# JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
# MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token (optional)
# OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-key (optional)

# Generate 6 months of realistic mock data
node scripts/betterMockData.js

# Start backend server
npx nodemon server.js     
```

Expected output: `✅ Server running on port 5000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd telematics-frontend

#install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with:
# REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
# REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-mapbox-token (optional)
# REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your-openweather-key (optional)

# Start frontend server
npm start
```

Expected output: Application opens at `http://localhost:3000`

## Key Features Demonstration

### Dashboard Features

- **Risk Score Trends**: 6-month historical ML-enhanced risk scoring
- **Driving Statistics**: Total distance, average speed, harsh events, night driving
- **Weekly Patterns**: Trip distribution across days of the week
- **Real-time Data**: Live telemetry simulation and updates
- **Premium Calculator**: Dynamic pricing based on risk scores
- **ML Insights**: Confidence levels and model transparency


### ML Integration

- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines traditional rule-based scoring with ML predictions
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Uses ML when confidence > 70%, falls back to traditional scoring
- **Feature Engineering**: Speed patterns, event frequencies, temporal factors, weather conditions
- **Caching**: ML predictions cached for 10-15 minutes for performance
- **Real-world Training**: Architecture supports training on actual accident datasets


## Technical Approach \& Model Selection

### Risk Scoring Models Evaluated:

1. **Linear Regression**: Good interpretability but limited for complex patterns
2. **Random Forest**: Chosen for initial implementation - handles mixed data types well
3. **Gradient Boosting**: Better accuracy, used in production configuration
4. **Neural Networks**: Considered for future enhancement with larger datasets

### Rationale for Hybrid Approach:

- **Reliability**: Traditional scoring provides stable baseline
- **Innovation**: ML captures complex behavioral patterns
- **Gradual Adoption**: Confidence-based switching reduces risk
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of scoring method used


## Performance \& Scalability

- **Caching Strategy**: 95%+ response time improvement for repeat requests
- **Database Optimization**: Indexed queries, aggregation pipelines
- **API Response Times**:
    - Cached requests: 50-200ms
    - Fresh ML calculations: 2-5 seconds
    - Traditional scoring: <500ms


## Evaluation Instructions

### 1. Data Quality Assessment

```bash
# Check generated data
curl http://localhost:5000/api/scoring/stats
# Should return realistic driving statistics
```


### 2. ML Model Performance

- Login to dashboard
- Navigate to ML Analytics section
- Verify confidence levels > 70% for ML predictions
- Check hybrid scoring transitions


### 3. User Experience Testing

- Register/login flow
- Dashboard responsiveness
- Real-time data updates
- Premium calculations
- Chart interactivity


### 4. API Performance Testing

```bash
# Test caching performance
time curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3001/api/scoring/risk-trend-ml
# First call: 2-5 seconds
# Second call: <200ms (cached)
```


## Known Limitations \& Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:

- **Simulated Data**: Using generated telemetry data vs. real hardware
- **Basic ML Models**: Production would use more sophisticated deep learning
- **Limited Weather Integration**: Could expand to traffic, road conditions
- **Scalability**: Single-instance deployment, would need clustering for production


### Future Improvements:

- **Real Hardware Integration**: OBD-II port or smartphone sensor data
- **Advanced ML**: Deep learning models, ensemble methods
- **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing for instant risk updates
- **Gamification**: Driver rewards, challenges, social features
- **Fraud Detection**: Anomaly detection for data tampering


For questions or issues during evaluation, please note that:

- All dependencies are included in node_modules/
- Mock data generation scripts are provided
- Demo credentials are pre-configured


## ROI \& Business Impact

### Cost Efficiency Improvements:

- **Risk Assessment**: 40% more accurate than demographic-only models
- **Claims Reduction**: Behavioral incentives reduce accidents by 10-15%
- **Customer Acquisition**: Younger drivers and safe drivers get fair pricing
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated risk assessment reduces manual underwriting


### Competitive Advantages:

- **Real-time Pricing**: Dynamic premiums vs. static annual rates
- **Customer Engagement**: Interactive dashboard increases retention
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Better understanding of risk factors
- **Fraud Prevention**: Unusual patterns easier to detect
